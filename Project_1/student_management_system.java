/*Ultimate Java Basics Practice Problem: Student Management System
This problem covers variables, loops, conditionals, arrays, strings,
 methods, classes, objects, and file handlingâ€”all in one go.

Create a Student Management System that allows a user to:
Add a new student (name, roll number, marks).
View all students.
Search for a student by roll number.
Calculate the average marks of all students.
Save student records to a file and load them on program restart.

Requirements & Concepts Covered
Variables & Data Types (Store student details: name, rollNo, marks).
Loops (Iterate over student records).
Conditionals (if-else for menu selection and searching).
Arrays/ArrayLists (Store multiple students).
Methods (Encapsulate operations: addStudent(), searchStudent(), etc.).
File Handling (Save and load student records).
